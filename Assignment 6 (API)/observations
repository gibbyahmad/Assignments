That the equator has some of the higest recorded temperatures and the polar tips have the coldest which is not surprising however the latitudal graph models the curve of the earth which is interesting.
There is no real correalation between humidity and latitude in cities spread out throughout the world
Some cities on the same latitudal line have either no clouds or all the clouds which is interesting but it is important to note that this graph does not take into account ground elevation
