1) Ramicane was the most effective drug over Capomulin but was not featured in the four test analysis. All drugs should be considered when running these tests. 
2) Ketapril preformed better in the long run compared to infubinol but during initial first few days the data showed Infubinol preforming better.
3) Capomulin preformed the best out of all tests by a significant degree. Further tests using Capomulin on mice with cancer alongside Ramicane should be done to ensure the best success in reducing tumour rates.
